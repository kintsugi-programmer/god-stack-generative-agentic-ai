## 📚 About This Repository

- https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/google-ai-agents-intensive_2025/home

This repository contains all my personal notes, codelab solutions, and resources from the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course** hosted by Google and Kaggle. The goal is to document my learning journey, store practical code examples, and build the final capstone project.

> **Official Course Description:**
> A course designed to help you build and deploy the next frontier of AI. This immersive experience will guide you through the architectures, tools, and best practices shaping the future of intelligent, autonomous systems. You'll put your skills into practice through a capstone project, and by the end of the course, you should gain a solid foundation to build everything from simple AI agents to sophisticated multi-agent systems.

## 🏆 Capstone Project

This is the final project to apply all concepts from the course. Participation is optional but a great portfolio builder.

* **Project Goal:** Build an agent demonstrating at least three features from the course.
* **Required Technology:** Must use the **ADK (Agent Development Kit)**.
* **My Project:** `[Link to my Capstone Project](./Capstone_Project/README.md)`
* **Submission Includes:**
    1.  Kaggle writeup
    2.  Video explaining the agent
    3.  Brief rationale
    4.  Link to source code

### Key Dates
* **Project Launch:** Friday, November 14, 2025
* **Submission Deadline:** Sunday, November 30, 2025, at 11:59 PM PT
